# Questions Creator
Questions Creator helps to generate encoded txt files used by my personal projects.

## Steps
- Add a question by clicking the + sign at the top.
- Fill the requested fields.
- Add all your questions (at least 2).
- Finally, click on the 'Create File' button at the bottom.

A txt file will be downloaded, named "QC-*some key*". Make sure the file name doesn't change.
